# GDP clusters vs location

# Overvieew

My first coding Project. This project analyzes the World Bank’s country income classification based on Gross National Income per capita. Using macroeconomic indicators and machine learning techniques, it explores the main factors affecting GDP per capita and performs cluster analysis to identify groups of countries with similar economic profiles, comparing the results with the World Bank’s classification.
