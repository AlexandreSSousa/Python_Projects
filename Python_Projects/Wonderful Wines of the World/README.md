#Wonderful Wines of the World

#Overview

In this project, we worked with customer data from a wine company to group customers with similar traits. After cleaning and preparing the data, we used unsupervised learning to find distinct customer groups. The analysis may help the company to understand its customers better and create more targeted marketing strategies.
